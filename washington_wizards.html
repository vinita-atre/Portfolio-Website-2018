                    <p>I created a responsive website using HTML, CSS, JQuery to get users to sign up for the Washington Wizards Game</p>

                    <h3>Discover Phase - User, Business &amp; Environment</h3>
                    <i>Created using Powerpoint</i>

                    <p><b>Understanding the Business needs</b></p>

                    <p>I am the project owner/user experience individual for company A. I need to build (visually) an experience to get users sign-up and attend the Washington Wizards game night on Oct 31, 2016 to increase revenue.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                    <p>I did initial research through basketball blogs, previous game videos, basketball news, Washington wizards blogs and new, twitter and Facebook page for Washington wizards to understand the target user . This also helped me to understand the culture and needs of the typical basketball game enthusiast. I created two personas: Primary and Secondary</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-8"><img id="personaImage" src="img/portfolio/GameExperience/PrimaryPersona_basketball.jpg" /></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p><b>Primary Persona: </b>My primary persona is John. John is a hardworking and sincere school teacher in middle school. He used to play basketball as a kid and now wants to engage his kid into the game too. John is not very tech savvy but uses social media and smartphones. John hates being overwhelmed with too much data. He has high emotional connectivity with basketball.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-8"><img id="personaImage" src="img/portfolio/GameExperience/SecondaryPersona_basketball.jpg" /></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p><b>Secondary Persona: </b>My secondary persona is James. James is a high school student who occasionally plays but prefers to follow the basketball game news. He also thinks of game events as a way to socialize and to hangout with his friends. Since he is a student, he is also more interested in offers and sales on game tickets. He is always on the go and needs a portable solution. He has a short attention span and get easily distracted by ads and secondary content on the websites.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <h3>Define Phase - Defining the problem</h3>
                    <i>Created using thinking by analyzing user goals, business goals and environment</i>

                    <p>How can we get people to sign up and attend the Washington Wizards game on 31st October 2016 to support the team, increase fan base and generate revenue ?</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <h3>Design Phase - Creating Wireframes</h3>
                    <i>Created using LucidCharts</i>

                    <p>I wanted to keep the user flow is simplistic and fast in order to prevent distractions to the user in their primary task of signing up for the game.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>The home screen is information with repetitive call for actions on the page to get users to actually sign up. The registration page is minimalist and even has social media authentication options.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <p>Since anyone with a email ID can sign up for the game and there is no age restriction, the payment screen is different for people above 18 years and others. Users above 18 years can enter their card details to make the online payment. However users under 18 year must defer the responsibility of payment to an adult.</p>
                    &nbsp;

                    <p>After payment completing the payment, the user get an electronic ticket which he can email to himself or print. The user constantly sees system status and where they are in the signup process. There is also a close button which is clearly visible if the user wishes to exit.</p>
                    &nbsp;
