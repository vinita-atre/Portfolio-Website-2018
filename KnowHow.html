							<p class="small"><i> " I am teaching a class in NYC and I need to mark who is present in order to get paid, but I couldn’t understand how to do that. I almost called the school, but my husband, thankfully, was able to make it work."</i> - User P.			
							</p>
							<p>Through our literature review
								<ol>
									<li> As people age, working memory declines. Seniors are often not digital natives, so navigating an interface that would be second nature to a younger user often results in an older user having to rely on their working memory to remember what certain icons and other visual shortcuts mean.</li>
									<li>
									In T.A. Hart et al.’s study, researchers found that information overload was common, especially in novice senior users. This overload is often a combination of too much information needing to be stored in working memory and a lack of ability to easily access basic information about completing tasks.</li>
									<li> Older people also tend to be less able to recover from user error and are therefore over all more hesitant in interacting with an interface, spending a great amount of their interaction time simply considering where to go.</li></ol>
								</p><br>
								<div style="background-color: black">
									<P style="color: white">THE PROBLEM
									</P>
									<p style="color: white" class="small">
										Older users are expected to understand and use web applications. Although some web applications contain help sections, it is a wall of text which does not selectively answer a user’s question. It may deter them from learning the application on their own and lead to reliance on family and friends.

								<p><b>2.Define Phase</b></p>
								<p>Meet our User: P.</p>
								<p class="small">A 70 year old female who is an Art Therapist and Lecturer, and is an Apple user who owns an Apple watch, Macbook, and an iPhone .She states her comfort level with technology as a 3 out of 5.</p>
								<p>
									Use case and context
								</p>
								<p class="small">
									Paula has started to lecture at the School of the Visual Arts in New York City. Upon her first lecture she needed to learn how to use Canvas, and the Google Suite. In using both she is constantly frustrated. She was expected to learn these applications and use them on her own.
								Usually, she is under a deadline to complete specific tasks, like create a Google Slides presentation, or update a Google Doc.</p>
								<div style="background-color: black">
									<p style="color:white"> THE IDEA
									</p>
									<p style="color:white" class="small"> To solve the issues like cognitive load , unfamiliarity with web apps and lack of guidance or help suited for older adults while using web apps, we created an interactive web based helper using collaborative design. We used the Google Docs web app use case for designing and testing our helper as our participant has use for it.
									</div>
									<p><b>Why Collaborative Design</b></p>

									<p class="small">In creating an interface for older users, collaborative design is essential to success. In D. Hawthorn’s article <a href ="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290601176930" target="blank">Interface design and engagement
									with older people</a>, researchers attempted to develop a successful interactive tutorial for older people. Throughout their design process, the researchers found large and unexpected inconsistencies in the designers’ assumptions and the way senior users interact with a system, further driving in the point that stakeholder participation in this context is vitally important.</p><br>
									<p><b>Why interactive web-based helper</b></p>

									<p class="small">We conducted an unstructured user interview session to find out their use of technology, their habits, what works for them and what does not. Our key findings:
										<ul>
											<li>
											User was prone to asking their daughter for assistance. User finds personal assistances much useful and points that personal assistance provides the advantage of one clear, concise, answer, as opposed to a number of search results that may use jargon or be otherwise inaccessible. </li>
											<li>
												Older users also tend to be less search-literate and are less practiced in wording their queries in a way that would yield the answer to their question. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Finally, older users are often not looking to master software, but to perform simple, individual tasks. Our participant strayed away from walkthroughs and tutorials, because they took too much time and gave her information she did not want or need.
											</li>
										</ul>

										Further,  we choose 2 sketches to add interaction for the tasks. The first sketch was an
										unobtrusive way to enable the user to interact with
										the bot on screen. This version also allowed the
										user to quickly recall the last conversations in case
										they needed to reference them. We chose sketch
										six, because we wanted to test how the user would
										react to the chatbot being accessible via right
										click, and how intense they wanted an overlay on
										the screen.

										For reviewing the wireframes with our users, we created 2 task- based wireflows.

							<li>User only uses a desktop for work on web apps so wants to see dekstop first design elements. They like the side bar char more than the pop up chat option.</li>

						<p><b>Building High Fidelity Prototype</b></p>
						<p class="small">Combining ideas from both the low fidelity prototype and its design review, we created a interactive high fidelity prototype. Aim was to improve the interaction</p>
						<p>Highlights of our high fidelity prototype:</p>
						<ul><li>We aimed to integrated the solution in the web browser instead of the web app as found out that the .</li>
							<li>								
								It is left aligned and occupies same height as the application. It contains
								chatbot interface that takes user input and guides user in performing tasks
							</li><li>The chatbot is not hard coded but is based on an intelligent agent. Our intelligent agent was named Alex as shown in fig 1. The intelligent agent is hybrid of rule based and machine learning. Due to the scope of creating a prototype, we did not train the
								agent using large dataset and take full advantage of the machine learning aspect. We defined rules in the intelligent agent as shown in fig 2. Knowhow uses Natural
							Language Processing (NLP) in its chatbot interface so that they can ask questions in a natural, conversational way. What this means is that user can ask questions</li>

				<p class="small">We focused on understanding the chatbot interactions and user acceptance. Further steps include studying chatbot help for different kinds of web applications. Limitations being that we only considered three tasks for our product. We also designed the Agent for Google Drive and Docs only. We learned that testing at each level of design is crucial to improving the underlying product.<br>
